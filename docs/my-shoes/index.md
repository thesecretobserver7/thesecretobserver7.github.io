<span class="first-word">H</span>ey there, it's been a while since I last sat down to write. Today, I want to share a story that's close to my heart—it's about a pair of shoes that have been with me through thick and thin.

I remember buying these shoes back in December 2019, about six months after I moved to a new country. A friend helped me pick them out, saying they suited me perfectly. I didn't hesitate to buy them, even though they cost me around 6500 yen, which was a bit of a splurge for me at the time. The shoe is from the company called FILA, and I think this is the first branded shoe that I bought in my life. Maybe that's why this shoe holds a special place in my heart. Currently, I own a dozen shoes from different brands, but none of them have that same level of connection as my FILA shoes.

What I loved most about these shoes was how comfy they were. From the moment I slipped them on, I knew they were special. They were so easy to wear, and they felt like they were made just for me. I could slip them on and off with ease, and they felt great on my feet. I wore them everywhere—in the snow during winter, in the scorching heat of summer, and even in the pouring rain during monsoon season.

For three whole years, these shoes were like my sidekicks. They never let me down, no matter what I was up to. Through the highs and lows of life, they were always there, supporting me every step of the way. I think my attachment to the shoes goes beyond their physical appearance or utility; it's a bond formed from the memories and emotions shared over the years. But over time, they started to wear out. The outer layer began peeling, and eventually, they got so worn that I couldn't wear them anymore.

Trying to find a replacement pair was a real challenge. I scoured the internet, but couldn't find the exact same ones anywhere. It seemed like they had stopped making them. Sure, I found similar ones in different colors, but it just wasn't the same—I didn't feel that same connection. These shoes weren't just footwear—they were a part of my identity, my travels, my journey. They matched perfectly with everything I wore, whether it was shorts, trousers, or pants.

Letting go of them? Man, that was tough. I've been trying to toss them out for the past two years, but every time I tried, I just couldn't do it. It's strange how we living beings can form attachments to non-living things, even if they're just shoes. So, I finally decided that it's time to let them go. As I bid farewell to my favorite FILA shoes, I'm flooded with memories of all the adventures we've been on together.  It's time to move on and make new memories, but I'll always be grateful for the comfort and support these shoes gave me.

As I bid farewell to my cherished shoes, I'm reminded that while physical objects may come and go, the memories and emotions they evoke remain etched in our hearts forever.
