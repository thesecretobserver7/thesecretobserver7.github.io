[{"categories":null,"content":" My Beloved FILA (Copyright © [2023] [TheSecretObserver]) Hey there, it’s been a while since I last sat down to write. Today, I want to share a story that’s close to my heart—it’s about a pair of shoes that have been with me through thick and thin. I remember buying these shoes back in December 2019, about six months after I moved to a new country. A friend helped me pick them out, saying they suited me perfectly. I didn’t hesitate to buy them, even though they cost me around 6500 yen, which was a bit of a splurge for me at the time. The shoe is from the company called FILA, and I think this is the first branded shoe that I bought in my life. Maybe that’s why this shoe holds a special place in my heart. Currently, I own a dozen shoes from different brands, but none of them have that same level of connection as my FILA shoes. What I loved most about these shoes was how comfy they were. From the moment I slipped them on, I knew they were special. They were so easy to wear, and they felt like they were made just for me. I could slip them on and off with ease, and they felt great on my feet. I wore them everywhere—in the snow during winter, in the scorching heat of summer, and even in the pouring rain during monsoon season. For three whole years, these shoes were like my sidekicks. They never let me down, no matter what I was up to. Through the highs and lows of life, they were always there, supporting me every step of the way. I think my attachment to the shoes goes beyond their physical appearance or utility; it’s a bond formed from the memories and emotions shared over the years. But over time, they started to wear out. The outer layer began peeling, and eventually, they got so worn that I couldn’t wear them anymore. My Beloved FILA (Copyright © [2023] [TheSecretObserver]) Trying to find a replacement pair was a real challenge. I scoured the internet, but couldn’t find the exact same ones anywhere. It seemed like they had stopped making them. Sure, I found similar ones in different colors, but it just wasn’t the same—I didn’t feel that same connection. These shoes weren’t just footwear—they were a part of my identity, my travels, my journey. They matched perfectly with everything I wore, whether it was shorts, trousers, or pants. Letting go of them? Man, that was tough. I’ve been trying to toss them out for the past two years, but every time I tried, I just couldn’t do it. It’s strange how we living beings can form attachments to non-living things, even if they’re just shoes. So, I finally decided that it’s time to let them go. As I bid farewell to my favorite FILA shoes, I’m flooded with memories of all the adventures we’ve been on together. It’s time to move on and make new memories, but I’ll always be grateful for the comfort and support these shoes gave me. “Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul, there is no such thing as separation.” - Rumi As I bid farewell to my cherished shoes, I’m reminded that while physical objects may come and go, the memories and emotions they evoke remain etched in our hearts forever.

But there’s a hidden treasure within Tokyo, a place surrounded by clear blue waters and beautiful hills - Okutama. It’s in the western part of Tokyo, about 60 kilometers away from the busy city center. Most of Okutama is part of the Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, and it’s covered in mountains and forests. In Okutama, you can find peace, nature, and lots of outdoor activities. It’s the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of central Tokyo. Since I came to Japan, I’ve been wanting to go hiking. I wanted to test myself and be in nature, but life’s been busy.Then, in the last few months, I just felt a strong pull to challenge myself and spend more time outdoors. So, I decided to go for it and bought hiking gear to motivate me. My desk job means I’m not very active, and I want to avoid health issues in the future, so I knew I needed to start moving more. When it was time to choose my first proper hiking spot, Okutama seemed like the perfect choice. It’s not too far from Tokyo, and I could do it in a day. I wanted to see if I could handle it and test my physical limits. The trip to Kori station, where my hike began, was a nearly three-hour train ride from my apartment. Inside the train, I saw many folks all set for hiking, and their enthusiasm was contagious. It got me really excited about the adventure. Stepping out of the station, I immediately felt the calmness of nature, with mountains all around and the soothing sound of the river. Once I reached Kori, I enjoyed a satisfying bowl of udon noodles to fuel up for the hike ahead. As I began my hike from Kori, I noticed that the Google map was suggesting a rather odd route. Not wanting to get lost, I approached some friendly locals for help. They were incredibly kind and pointed me in the right direction. It was during this exchange that they thoughtfully mentioned the possibility of bears in the area. It dawned on me that I had forgotten to bring bear bells and bear spray. Yet, seeing so many fellow hikers that day, I reassured myself that the chances of encountering a bear were quite low. I crossed a bridge over the Tama River to reach the other side, and from there, I followed a trail alongside the river. Down below, I noticed folks fishing and others just relishing the beauty of nature. I even came across couples sitting on rocks, having a chat, and looking genuinely content. It made me appreciate how love and the great outdoors go hand in hand. After that, I made my way into the forest, leaving the river behind. As I journeyed, I stumbled upon some lovely little waterfalls, which were quite charming. The trail soon started to incline, and I could feel myself getting tired and out of breath. I realized my stamina might be on the lower side.However, the path was considerate and had resting spots, where I could catch my breath and move at my own pace. While climbing, I couldn’t help but notice the orderly rows of trees on the hillside, a truly beautiful sight. _Into the Wild_ Location: [Okutama, Tokyo, Japan], Date: [Oct 08, 2023] (Copyright © [2023] [TheSecretObserver]) Eventually, the challenging uphill stretch came to an end, and I began a descent, passing through a small area with houses and roads. To my surprise, when I checked my map, I realized I had only covered about 10 percent of the hike, even though it felt like I’d come much farther. I chuckled at that thought, took a break, and kept going. Luckily, there were plenty of signs to keep hikers from getting lost. The next part had me walking alongside the river again, and the water was a stunning emerald green. I walked on the stones by the river’s edge, listening to the water’s gentle flow. It brought me a sense of peace and joy, making me feel alive and full of energy.

Yahiko, Niigata, Japan], Date: [Feb 24, 2023] (Copyright © [2023] [TheSecretObserver]) I've had the desire to create an online blog for nearly a decade now. It's been a persistent dream of mine, a place where I can pour out my musings online. While I've been keeping daily journals over the years, sharing my inner thoughts on the internet feels like an entirely different challenge. I’ve tried several times before - writing stories, sharing thoughts or sharing my travel experiences, but something always got in the way and I’ve often given up. I believe it’s because of my fear of judgment or the concern that I might become too obsessed with writing, unable to stop. It’s a peculiar fear, I admit. Maybe it’s my reluctance to confront the thoughts residing within me. I’ve avoided facing them directly. Yet, I’ve come to realize that writing is how you really get to know yourself and a way to truly comprehend one’s thoughts. It’s a journey of self-discovery. Confronting these fears is essential, no matter how daunting they may seem. And so, I’ve finally taken the leap and made this blog, ’thesecretobserver.com.’ The name reflects my nature - I’m an avid observer of the world around me. It’s ingrained in me, almost a survival instinct, and an inherent part of who I am. When I find myself in a new environment, my mind automatically switches into observation mode, paying close attention to everything. Sometimes, as I write my daily journals, my thoughts just flow freely, and upon reading my words later, I’m often surprised by the realization that these inner thoughts existed within me without my conscious awareness. Over the last 3-4 years, writing daily journals really helped me deal with my anxiety and overthinking. I’m still thinking the extent to which I should filter my thoughts, but I believe I’ll figure it out as I go along. At this very moment, as I’m typing this in my work PC, I can feel myself getting caught up in worrying if my writing is up to par or if my sentences are correct. It’s time to let go of this overthinking and wrap up my first post. I’m planning to write shorter posts because it helps me stay consistent with my writing. Being consistent is more important than focusing too much on quality or other aspects. Additionally, I’m considering sharing my favorite quotes, memorable movie dialogues, or something I’ve come across at the end of each post. For this post I want to share a quote from a book I love, ‘Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.’ This book means a lot to me and has given me confidence. I think it’s a great read for introverts. The quote goes like this: ‘There’s a word for “people who are in their heads too much”: thinkers.’ - Susan Cain ","date":"2023-09-14","objectID":"/hello_world/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"The Beginning: My Journey as \"The Secret Observer\"","uri":"/hello_world/"}]
