<span class="first-word">W</span>hen Tokyo comes to mind, we usually think of a bustling city with tall buildings and bright lights. But there's a hidden treasure within Tokyo, a place surrounded by clear blue waters and beautiful hills - Okutama. It's in the western part of Tokyo, about 60 kilometers away from the busy city center. Most of Okutama is part of the Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, and it's covered in mountains and forests. In Okutama, you can find peace, nature, and lots of outdoor activities. It's the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of central Tokyo.

Since I came to Japan, I've been wanting to go hiking. I wanted to test myself and be in nature, but life's been busy.Then, in the last few months, I just felt a strong pull to challenge myself and spend more time outdoors. So, I decided to go for it and bought hiking gear to motivate me. My desk job means I'm not very active, and I want to avoid health issues in the future, so I knew I needed to start moving more.

When it was time to choose my first proper hiking spot, Okutama seemed like the perfect choice. It's not too far from Tokyo, and I could do it in a day. I wanted to see if I could handle it and test my physical limits.

The trip to Kori station, where my hike began, was a nearly three-hour train ride from my apartment. Inside the train, I saw many folks all set for hiking, and their enthusiasm was contagious. It got me really excited about the adventure.

Stepping out of the station, I immediately felt the calmness of nature, with mountains all around and the soothing sound of the river. Once I reached Kori, I enjoyed a satisfying bowl of udon noodles to fuel up for the hike ahead.
As I began my hike from Kori, I noticed that the Google map was suggesting a rather odd route. Not wanting to get lost, I approached some friendly locals for help. They were incredibly kind and pointed me in the right direction. It was during this exchange that they thoughtfully mentioned the possibility of bears in the area. It dawned on me that I had forgotten to bring bear bells and bear spray. Yet, seeing so many fellow hikers that day, I reassured myself that the chances of encountering a bear were quite low.


I crossed a bridge over the Tama River to reach the other side, and from there, I followed a trail alongside the river. Down below, I noticed folks fishing and others just relishing the beauty of nature. I even came across couples sitting on rocks, having a chat, and looking genuinely content. It made me appreciate how love and the great outdoors go hand in hand.

After that, I made my way into the forest, leaving the river behind. As I journeyed, I stumbled upon some lovely little waterfalls, which were quite charming. The trail soon started to incline, and I could feel myself getting tired and out of breath. I realized my stamina might be on the lower side.However, the path was considerate and had resting spots, where I could catch my breath and move at my own pace. While climbing, I couldn't help but notice the orderly rows of trees on the hillside, a truly beautiful sight.

Eventually, the challenging uphill stretch came to an end, and I began a descent, passing through a small area with houses and roads. To my surprise, when I checked my map, I realized I had only covered about 10 percent of the hike, even though it felt like I'd come much farther. I chuckled at that thought, took a break, and kept going. Luckily, there were plenty of signs to keep hikers from getting lost.

The next part had me walking alongside the river again, and the water was a stunning emerald green. I walked on the stones by the river's edge, listening to the water's gentle flow. It brought me a sense of peace and joy, making me feel alive and full of energy. During this part, I met a lot of people walking in the opposite direction. It seemed like most people did the hike from Okutama to Kori, the opposite of my route.

I reached a dam, and the water there had a stunning blue hue. The trail that followed the dam alongside the lake turned out to be the most scenic part of the hike. I walked alongside the serene waters and even spotted people enjoying kayaking, having a wonderful time. It filled me with a sense of tranquility and a unique kind of vitality. I wished I could stay there forever, listening to the rustling leaves and chirping birds while gazing at the water.This experience was my refuge from the chaos of my daily life. For the past two weeks, I had been buried in work, and this hike arrived just in time to offer me a precious opportunity to take a break, unwind, and recharge.

Eventually, I made it to Okutama after covering nearly 8 kilometers on my hike. While I was there, I had a unique encounter with a local gentleman who was out walking his dog. When he asked where I was from and I mentioned my country, he got quite excited and told me he knew about Mount Everest. It was a pleasant surprise to find a connection like that in such a remote place.To my delight, this friendly local invited me into his home, where he offered me a glass of refreshing apple juice. He shared his story about moving to Okutama during the pandemic and now living there with his faithful dog. It was a heartwarming encounter, and I expressed my gratitude before resuming my exploration of Okutama town.

While strolling through the town, I came across a shop that specialized in wasabi products. They cultivated organic wasabi right there in the region. The friendly shopkeeper offered me a variety of products to taste and took the time to explain each one. It was another reminder of the excellent customer service you often find in Japan, where customers are treated with utmost respect.

After exploring the town, I made my way to Okutama station. The station had a charming, old-world appearance, and I needed to stop by and inform the station master that I had lost my train card somewhere in the forest. Fortunately, the station master was incredibly helpful in resolving the issue, making my journey back home a little less stressful.

Boarding the train for my journey home, my body was tired from the hike, and I found myself half-asleep. Yet, my spirit was lifted, and I felt rejuvenated. I made a personal commitment to continue hiking throughout the autumn season, when the leaves would transform into a beautiful tapestry of colors. Equipped with the right gear and a heart full of determination, I was ready to embrace the forthcoming challenges and beauty that nature had in store.

In the end, Okutama wasn't just a hike; it was a journey of self-discovery. It reminded me of the harmony that nature and solitude can bring to our lives. I cherished the opportunity to break free from the relentless demands of daily life, finding solace and renewal amid the whispering rivers, old trees, and friendly locals.

Finally, as a ritual for all my posts, I leave you with a quote that captures the essence of my hiking adventure in Okutama, and it's a piece of wisdom from the world of Harry Potter: 

> 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light.' — Albus Dumbledore. 

Just as I found my own 'light' during this journey, may you find yours, no matter where life takes you. Until the next adventure, stay curious and keep exploring!
