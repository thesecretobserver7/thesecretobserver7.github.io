<span class="first-word">I</span>t’s been a while since I last wrote… I recently returned home after two and a half years, and the experience was nothing short of surreal. But today, I want to share something that really touched me during my trip—something that shook me to my core, something that made me weep inside. It was one of those moments that broke something inside me, something I didn’t even realize needed breaking.

My family and I went to visit one of our distant relatives. He’s nearly 56, and sadly, he was diagnosed with blood cancer. What I saw that day was so heartbreaking that it’s hard to put into words. The toll that such an illness takes on a person is unfathomable, and witnessing it firsthand was a cruel reminder of how fleeting life truly is.

I saw him there, unable to get up without assistance. His body was swollen beyond recognition, a result of the illness and the treatments. He could barely speak, his words slurred and slow, weighed down by the powerful medications coursing through his system. He was gasping for air, struggling with every breath as if each one could be his last. The doctors had done all they could, but the cancer had spread so far that they could no longer help. They sent him home, knowing there was little time left. It felt as though he was just there, waiting—waiting for the inevitable to claim him with every passing second.

What truly broke my heart was seeing his family—the ones who loved him most. His wife, daughter, and son, each one of them carrying a heavy weight of sorrow in their eyes. They knew their time with him was limited. Every conversation, every glance, was tinged with an understanding of the inevitable. The air was thick with sadness, a palpable weight that I could feel pressing down on me. It was impossible not to feel their pain.

A few days later, we received the news that he had passed away. In that moment, I couldn’t help but think that, maybe, in some way, he was free from the pain now. Somewhere out there, he had lived his life, and now, perhaps, he was at peace.

This experience made me realize just how rich people are—those who are healthy and have a healthy family. I’m so fortunate to have both, and it’s a gift I often take for granted. But this trip reminded me that life is fragile, and the moments we have are not guaranteed. It taught me to treasure every laugh, every moment of happiness, because we never know when things might change. Our health is something we must never take lightly—diseases like cancer don’t give you a chance to fight back once they’ve taken hold. That’s why it’s so important to take care of ourselves: to eat well, exercise regularly, and live life to the fullest.

And above all, when our time does come, we should live in a way that leaves our loved ones with memories of us that bring them comfort, not sorrow. Life is precious, and it’s up to us to cherish it every single day.

Like  Khalil Gibran, said: 

> “You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.”

This quote resonates deeply—it reminds me that true giving comes from the heart, through our love, time, and presence, not just material things. It’s the connections we make and the care we offer that leave a lasting impact.

Life will always move forward, no matter the challenges or heartache we face. While we can’t change the inevitable, we can choose how we live in the present. Each moment, each heartbeat, is a gift—one that should be cherished. And in the end, it’s not about how long we live, but about how deeply we love, how fully we live, and how we are remembered by those we leave behind.

Let us be mindful of the preciousness of life, of the people we love, and of the simple joys that fill our days. Because, in the end, that’s what truly matters.
